<h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5><p>Each lab has a section of supplementary exercises; these exercises are fully keyed with solutions. The supplementary exercises are not simply copies of the problems in the lab activities. While some questions will look familiar, many others will challenge you to apply the material covered in the lab to a new type of problem. These questions are meant to supplement your textbook homework, not replace your textbook homework.</p><span class="incontext"><a href="clm.html#p-26">in-context</a></span>
