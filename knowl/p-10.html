<h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5><p>A “for-screen-reading” PDF is available at <a class="external-url" href="http://spot.pcc.edu/math/clm/clm-screen.pdf" target="_blank"><tt class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">http://spot.pcc.edu/math/clm/clm-screen.pdf</tt></a>. This version is intended to be stored on an electronic device and read when an internet connection is unavailable. It has page dimensions compatible with most laptops and tablets. The pages are not numbered since the page numbering would be inconsistent with the print versions, so this version should be navigated by section numbering. Because the page dimensions are customized for electronic devices, this version would also look strange printed on standard paper. Since this version is not intended to be printed, full solutions to the supplemental problems are offered. Keep in mind that even if you store this PDF version on your electronic device, when an internet connection is available, you might opt to use the HTML version instead, as that version has more interactive and accessible functionality than the PDF version.</p><span class="incontext"><a href="clm.html#p-10">in-context</a></span>
