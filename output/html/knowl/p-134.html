<h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5><p>\(\frac{\fe{v}{7.5}-\fe{v}{0}}{7.5-0}=-13\frac{1}{3}\). This value tells us that during the first 7.5 s of descent, the average rate of change in the coaster's velocity is \(-13\frac{1}{3}\,\frac{\text{ft/s}}{\text{s}}\).  In other words, <!--Style me with CSS--><em>on average</em>, with each passing second the velocity is \(13\frac{1}{3}\,\text{ft}{s}\) less than it was the preceding second.  We could also say that the average acceleration experienced by the coaster over the first 7.5 s of descent is \(-13\frac{1}{3}\,\frac{\text{ft/s}}{\text{s}}\).</p><span class="incontext"><a href="rates-of-change-supplementary-exercises.html#p-134">in-context</a></span>
