<h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5><p>The lab activities have been written under the presumption that students will be working in groups and will be actively discussing the examples and problems included in each activity. Many of the exercises and problems lend themselves quite naturally to discussion. Some of the more algebraic problems are not so much discussion problems as they are “practice and help” problems.</p><span class="incontext"><a href="to-the-student.html#p-17">in-context</a></span>
