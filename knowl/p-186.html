<h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5><p>The algebraic limit laws allow us to replace limit expressions with equivalent limit expressions. When applying limit laws our first goal is to come up with an expression in which every limit in the expression can be replaced with its value based upon one of the replacement laws. This process is shown in <a knowl="./knowl/example-apply-limit-laws.html" knowl-id="xref-example-apply-limit-laws" alt="Example 2.2.1 Applying Limit Laws" title="Example 2.2.1 Applying Limit Laws">ExampleÂ 2.2.1</a>. Please note that all replacement laws are saved for the second to last step and that each replacement is explicitly shown. Please note also that each limit law used is referenced by number.</p><span class="incontext"><a href="clm.html#p-186">in-context</a></span>
