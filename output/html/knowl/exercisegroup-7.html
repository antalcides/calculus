The velocity of the rock (<sup>ft</sup>‚ÅÑ<sub>s</sub>) was given by \(\fe{v}{t}=60-32t\) where \(t\) was the number of seconds that had passed since Nigel chucked the rock.</p></article><div class="exercisegroup-exercises">

<p id="p-84">What, <!--Style me with CSS--><em>including unit</em>, are the values of \(\fe{v}{0}\), \(\fe{v}{1}\), and \(\fe{v}{2}\) and what do these values tell you in the context of this problem? Don't just write that the values tell you the velocity at certain times; explain what the velocity values tell you about the motion of the rock.</p></article><article class="exercise-like" id="exercise-24"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">16</span></h5>
