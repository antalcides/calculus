<p id="p-342">\(f\) is discontinuous from both directions at \(0\) and the discontinuity is not removable. \(f\) is discontinuous at \(3\) although it is continuous from the left at \(3\).  The discontinuity is not removable.  (The problem is that the limits are different from the left and right of \(3\).) \(f\) is discontinuous from both directions at \(4\) but the discontinuity is removable (\(\lim\limits_{x\to4}\fe{f}{x}=1\)). \(f\) is discontinuous from both directions at \(2\pi\) but the discontinuity is removable (\(\lim\limits_{x\to2\pi}\fe{f}{x}=1\)).</p></span><span class="incontext"><a href="clm.html#solution-24">in-context</a></span>
