<h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5><p>Suppose that an object is tossed directly upward in the air in such a way that the elevation of the object (measured in ft) is given by the function \(f\) defined by \(\fe{f}{t}=40+40t-16t^2\) where \(t\) is the amount of time that has passed since the object was tossed (measured in s).</p><span class="incontext"><a href="clm.html#p-70">in-context</a></span>
