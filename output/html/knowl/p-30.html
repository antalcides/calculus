<h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5><p>It is strongly recommended that you pick and choose what you consider to be the most vital activities for a given week, and that you have your students work those activities first. For some activities you might also want to have the students only work selected problems in the activity. Students who complete the high priority activities and problems can then go back and work the activities that they initially skipped. There are also fully keyed problems in the supplementary exercises that the students could work on both during lab time and outside of class. (The full solutions are only in the HTML and screen PDF versions.)</p><span class="incontext"><a href="to-the-instructor.html#p-30">in-context</a></span>
