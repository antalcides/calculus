<h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5><p>However, all those units in the original formula might distract you from new calculus topics. We <!--Style me with CSS--><em>could</em> just write \(\fe{p}{t}=200-4.9t^2\), but if we do so, we <!--Style me with CSS--><em>have</em> to specify that \(t\) is in seconds and \(\fe{p}{t}\) is in meters. With this formula, we can calculate something like \(\fe{p}{5}\), but we need to recognize that in context, the \(5\) means that \(5\) <!--Style me with CSS--><em>seconds</em> have passed. And when we arrive at the result, \(\fe{p}{5}=77.5\), we need to realize that the position is \(77.5\) <!--Style me with CSS--><em>meters</em>.</p><span class="incontext"><a href="section-velocity.html#p-39">in-context</a></span>
