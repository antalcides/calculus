<article class="introduction" id="introduction-6"><p id="p-82">Timmy lived a long life in the 19th century. When Timmy was seven he found a rock that weighed exactly half a stone. (Timmy lived in jolly old England, don't you know.) That rock sat on Timmy's window sill for the next 80 years and wouldn't you know the weight of that rock did not change even one smidge the entire time. In fact, the weight function for this rock was \(\fe{w}{t}=0.5\) where \(\fe{w}{t}\) was the weight of the rock (stones) and \(t\) was the number of years that had passed since that day Timmy brought the rock home.</p></article><div class="exercisegroup-exercises">
