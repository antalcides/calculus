<h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5><p>The formalistic way to read \(\lim\limits_{x\to\infty}\fe{f}{x}=L\) is “the limit of \(\fe{f}{x}\) as \(x\) approaches infinity equals \(L\).” When read that way, however, the words need to be taken <!--Style me with CSS--><em>anything but literally</em>. In the first place, \(x\) isn't approaching anything! The entire point is that \(x\) is increasing without any bound on how large its value becomes. Secondly, there is no place on the real number line called “infinity”; infinity is not a number. Hence \(x\) certainly can't be approaching something that isn't even there!</p><span class="incontext"><a href="section-limits-at-infinity.html#p-211">in-context</a></span>
