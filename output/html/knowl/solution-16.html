<p id="p-143">\(\frac{\fe{a}{120}-\fe{a}{60}}{120-60}=0.13\). This value tells us that during the second minute of flight, the average rate of change in the rocket's acceleration is 0.13 <sup>mph</sup>⁄<sub>s s</sub>.  In other words, <!--Style me with CSS--><em>on average</em>, with each passing second the acceleration  is 0.13 <sup>mph</sup>⁄<sub>s</sub> more than it was the preceding second.  You might have noticed that since the acceleration function is linear, the rate of change in the acceleration is constant.  That is, with each passing second the acceleration <!--Style me with CSS--><em>actually is</em> 0.13 <sup>mph</sup>⁄<sub>s</sub> more than it was the preceding second.</p></span><span class="incontext"><a href="rates-of-change-supplementary-exercises.html#solution-16">in-context</a></span>
