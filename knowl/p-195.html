<h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5><p>Many limits have the form \(\frac{0}{0}\) which means the expressions in both the numerator and denominator limit to zero (e.g.\(\lim\limits_{x\to3}\frac{2x-6}{x-3}\)). The form \(\frac{0}{0}\) is called <em class="terminology">indeterminate</em> because we do not know the value of the limit (or even if it exists) so long as the limit has that form. When confronted with limits of form \(\frac{0}{0}\) we must first manipulate the expression so that common factors causing the zeros in the numerator and denominator are isolated. Limit law A7 can then be used to justify eliminating the common factors and once they are gone we may proceed with the application of the remaining limit laws. <a knowl="./knowl/example-first-indeterminate.html" knowl-id="xref-example-first-indeterminate" alt="Example 2.3.1 " title="Example 2.3.1 ">2.3.1</a> and <a knowl="./knowl/example-second-indeterminate.html" knowl-id="xref-example-second-indeterminate" alt="Example 2.3.2 " title="Example 2.3.2 ">2.3.2</a> illustrate this situation.</p><span class="incontext"><a href="clm.html#p-195">in-context</a></span>
