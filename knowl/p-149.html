<h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5><p>Please note that we could not deduce the rate of change \(4\) minutes into the process by replacing \(h\) with \(0\); in fact, there are at least two things preventing us from doing so. From a strictly mathematical perspective, we cannot replace \(h\) with \(0\) because that would lead to division by zero in the difference quotient. From a more physical perspective, replacing \(h\) with \(0\) would in essence stop the clock. If time is frozen, so is the amount of fluid in the vat and the entire concept of “rate of change” becomes moot.</p><span class="incontext"><a href="clm.html#p-149">in-context</a></span>
