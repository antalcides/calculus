<h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5><p>Most of the time the value of a function at the number \(a\) and the limit of the function as \(x\) approaches \(a\) are in fact the same number. When this occurs we say that the function is <em class="terminology">continuous</em> at \(a\). We will explore the concept of continuity more in depth at the end of the this lab, once we have a handle on the idea of limits. To help you better understand the concept of limit we need to have you confront situations where the function value and limit value are not equal to one another. Graphs can be useful for helping distinguish function values from limit values, so that is the perspective you are going to use in the first couple of problems in this lab.</p><span class="incontext"><a href="clm.html#p-152">in-context</a></span>
