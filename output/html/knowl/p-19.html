<h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5><p>While working through the lab activities, the students in a given group should be working on the same activity at the same time. Sometimes this means an individual student will have to go a little more slowly than he or she may like and sometimes it means an individual student will need to move on to the next activity before he or she fully grasps the current activity.</p><span class="incontext"><a href="to-the-student.html#p-19">in-context</a></span>
